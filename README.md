# Django-Weather-API
This is my django rest framework weather API which allows me to create a full stack project in where I don't just use DRF as a backed technology because I also use React with next js to build the frontend interface. Stay in this project and you will see the readme file in order to check what are the all dependencies that you need to have in count.
